<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Anish Mahapatra, a 3rd-year undergraduate student at Manipal University Jaipur, 
passionate about artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data-driven problem solving. Over the past few years,
I’ve been exploring how intelligent systems can be applied to real-world challenges, from prediction models to automation tools,
while building a strong foundation in software development and algorithms.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I’m actively involved in the MUJ ACM SIGAI chapter, 
  where I worked as a team head for finance and registration, contributing to large-scale events like Elicit, 
  our annual techno-cultural fest. These experiences have sharpened my organizational,
   leadership, and teamwork skills, alongside my technical journey.</p>

<p>On GitHub, you’ll find my experiments, projects, and learnings ranging from AI/ML research projects to hands-on coding explorations. 
  I see this space as both a personal learning log and a way to collaborate with others who share similar interests. Always eager to learn, build, and share,
   I’m working toward creating impactful solutions while continuously growing as a developer and researcher.</p>
